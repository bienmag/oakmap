# OAKMAP

## Description:
Oakmap is a user-friendly tool designed for creating educational roadmaps. It simplifies the process of planning and visualizing educational journeys, making it easy for educators, students, and anyone interested in structured learning to create and share roadmaps for various subjects and goals.

## Getting Started:
Feel free to explore Oakmap using the following link: [OAKMAP](https://oakmap.vercel.app/)

You can browse the trees created by us or create your own trees by simply logging in with your Gmail account and clicking the "+" button on the main Dashboard. You will be redirected to the page of your newly created tree. By default, it's set to "Reader" mode. To add branches and leaves, click the "Edit" button in the right corner. You can add nodes by dragging them to your tree map. Once a node is placed, you can link it to its parent. To name a node, simply double-click on it and start typing. To add Markdown text, click on a node and then select "Markdown." A markdown panel will appear on the right. When you finish adding the markdown text, click outside of the markdown panel to close it.
